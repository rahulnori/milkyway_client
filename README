Please use the new repository at
  http://github.com/arsenm/milkywayathome_client

The old one was not properly / actually migrated from CVS, losing
history etc. The new one is an actual import from the old repository.

Hypothetically I've repeated any changes that were made to this
repository since it was created into the new one, on top of the
history from the old CVS. If something is broken or missing and you
want me to fix it, just let me know or you can try to do it yourself.

4. Where to make changes if the Milkyway@Home algorithm changes

5. Description of each file
coords.c/coords.h
  Calculates different coordinates
cpu_coords.c/cpu_coords.h
  Conversions for galactic coordinates and sgr 
cpu_r_constants.c/cpu_r_constants.h
  Used to determine precomputed contants for loading onto the GPU
evaluation_gpu.h
  Header file that contains the prototypes for the GPU functions
evaluation_gpu6.cu
  Main part of the CUDA code, it is responsible for doing the following
  1. Precomputing constants for the GPU to use
  2. Setting up all of the memory and transfering it to the GPU
  3. Choosing the proper GPU to use
  4. Calling each of the GPU kernels
  5. Calculating the final likelihood
  This file is very similar to the role evaluation_optimized.c plays in the CPU version
evaluation_gpu6_double_shared.cu
  Contains the shared memory optimized version of the integral kernel, this file
  is similar to the function calculate_probabilities in evaluation_optimized.c
evaluation_gpu6_double.cu/evaluation_gpu6_double_const.cu/evaluation_gpu6_double_global.cu
  Old integral kernels that make use of different memory types
evaluation_gpu6_float.cu
  Old single precision version of the CUDA kernels
evaluation_gpu6_likelihood.cu
  Contains the likelihood kernel that takes in the values of the background and stream
  integrals.  It is very similar to the integral kernel but each thread needs to compute
  different constant values so the two could not be merged, like in the CPU version
evaluation_gpu6_macros.cu
  Macros that are used to call the GPU kernels, these make it so the code is easier to read
  in evaluation_gpu6.cu
gauss_legendre.c/gauss_legendre.h
  Used precompute contants
pi_constants.h
  Header file
r_constants.h
  Header file
